# Poll-TUI
Instant text based polling with custom question and options


üó≥Ô∏è Python Voting Poll (TUI)
This is a simple Text User Interface (TUI) Python program designed to simulate a voting poll for straightforward decision-making within a group.

‚ú® Key Features
Question and Option Entry: Users can enter a poll question and multiple options. The system includes an edit menu to confirm, add, or remove options before proceeding.



Voter Registration: Voters register by name and are automatically assigned a random 4-digit Voter ID (between 1000 and 10000).




Polling: Registered voters cast their votes using their unique Voter ID. The program validates the ID, prevents multiple votes by the same voter, and ensures votes are cast for valid options.





Anonymity: The code is designed so that the voting information is not stored and votes are anonymous.

Results: The program calculates and displays the winner(s). It correctly handles and reports a tie when two or more options receive the maximum number of votes. It also displays the total vote count for every option.
